//: Use `extension` to add functionality to an existing type, such as new methods and computed properties. You can use an extension to add protocol conformance to a type thatâ€™s declared elsewhere, or even to a type that you imported from a library or framework.
 

class Circle {
    var radius: Double = 10
}
//: Experiment 1: try to make this line work
let cShape: ShapeProtocol = Circle()

extension Circle: ShapeProtocol {
    
    func area() -> Double {
        return Double.pi * radius * radius
    }
    
    var name: String {
        return "Circle"
    }
}

 
//: Experiment 2: add perimeter() -> Doubles in ShapeProtocol, make the Circle, Square , Triangle still confrm to the protocol
